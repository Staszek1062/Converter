# converter
Number System Converter is easy to use tool to convert Binary, Octal, Decimal and 
Hexadecimal to one another.ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning java. It's my first project 
in Java. I didnt use prepared functions for this type of convertion it bould be easer 
but wheres the challenge. The Converter was my first idea for a project im sure there 
is lot to improve but i will slowly get there.Anyways i will be creating more o these 
in the future.
